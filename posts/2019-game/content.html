    This was an attempt at creating my own game. Once again, at the start of the project I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make.<br><br>
    This ended up being my first encounter with TDD, which I experienced as tedious and annoying. However, in hindsight, it was a very good exercise.<br><br>
    This was also the first project where I started paying serious attention to design and implementation patterns.
