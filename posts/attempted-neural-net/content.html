For me, this project was initially a way to explore the C++ programming language. I had heard for many years that it is very complicated and thus decided to challenge myself.

<p>At first I didn't know what exactly I wanted to make, although I did know I wanted to make use of manual memory management. So, like any other person would do, I started to make dynamic arrays, arrays of arrays and more of these sorts of things.<br><br>In the same time period a friend of mine came up to me and said he had started to work on a neural net himself. So I basically took his idea and convinced myself I would do it better. The only difference was that he was using python and libraries which included software for neural net training.</p>
