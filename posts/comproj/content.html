    Me and a friend decided to create a chat app that was private. We used the java spring boot framework to get started.
    The goal was to have a messaging app where messages were only stored somewhere by choice of the user, and even if they are stored they're encrypted.
    <br><br>We took our own shot at encrypting the messages, the public/private keypair is created locally in the clients browser. The public key is plainly stored in the server, and the private key is encrypted with the users's password and is then also stored in the server's database.
    When the user logs in the password is queried from the server's database and decrypted only in the client's browser.
    <br><br>We actually got the system up and running and we've done some beta testing. But since then we have both been too occupied with our university study to go for a full launch of the product.
    <br><br>Also we never decided on a name so now its ChatApp in some places and Comproj (communcation project) in other places.
