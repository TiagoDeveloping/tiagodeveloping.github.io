    This is my third(and best) take on a project that originated in 2021 in which aimed to create a very simple http server.
    At the time this seemed nearly impossible for me(which is why it took me three iterations to create a product that I was happy with) but it ended up not being super bad.<br><br>
    The purpose of the iterations was mainly to improve on the design choices I'd made in the previous iteration, and add add more features I thought to be useful.<br><br>
    In the end I'd implemented logging, database communication, property files, and actually managed to make everything work together. Which I was very happy with(keeping in mind I was 16 at the time).<br><br>
    Unfortunately, I never got to completely finish it because other things that needed my attention came around.
