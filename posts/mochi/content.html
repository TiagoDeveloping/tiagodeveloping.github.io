    Mochi was a project I created for a university assignment. It was our univeristy porject that involved stakeholders. We had to do a requirement analysis and then we started working. All members in our team had prior experience in (web)programming and everyone's tasks were assigned according to their skills. It was a very nice experience working on the project.<br>
    Not to mention to final product was really cool(We won the best project award for that year).<br><br>
    We had a few features that were mandatory to implement, but those weren't enough for us. We kept having cool ideas for additional features and kept implementing them as we came up with them.<br>
    The base requirements were:<br>
    1. Logger functionality, able to distinguish different activities, allowing users to log through: 1. Timer System. 2. Check-in + Check-out System.<br>
    2. User profiles with levels and experience.<br>
    3. Global Leaderboard showing users, their levels, and their Mochi.<br>
    4. Challenges between at least 2 users.<br>
    5. Users should be able to login, adjust and create accounts.<br>
    6. Users should be able to view logged activities.<br>
    7. Ensure that the application is secure.<br>
    Additionally to these features we included an AI assistant, a live multiplayer feature using websockets, live messaging in the multiplayed sessions, a 'throwable' mochi(this meant you could take the mochi and throw it around the screen as a form of a game... it would also squish when it hit a wall).
    We also added customization of the mochi, where you can pick up to 3 different accessories to personalize your mochi.<br><br>

    We implement the time tracker as a very compact yet simple interface so a user can come and use the application without having to mess around with lots of buttons.

    In addition to all this, the code was really clean both the backend and frontend.<br><br>

    The technologies we used were:<br>
    - VueJS and typescript for the frontend<br>
    - Jakarta for the backend<br>
    - sl4j for logging<br>
    - JUnit for testing<br>
    - PostgreSQL for the database<br><br>
