    This was the first real project I worked on back in 2018 when I was 13 years old.<br>
    I played a lot of minecraft, just like my friends, and I would watch gameplay videos as well. And i found a series from one of my favourite creators that included something that wasn't in the game, some sort of item which gave you special powers. And I couldn't figureo out how it worked in my minecraft, so I started digging and figured out it was a plugin on a server. I was absolutely flabbergasted about the fact that something 'impossible' could be added into the game.<br>
    Then I decided to create my own interpretation of this item to play on my own server with my friends.<br><br>
    It took me a good few months before I'd managed to create a well working plugin but I got there. And sice I liked it so much I decided to publish it in dev.bukkit.org which is a platform where other people could download plugins.<br>
    I managed to end up with a few thousand downloads.<br><br>
    Then I started making a lot more such plugins for minecraft but most of them were for private servers that ended up not staying alive. But that did allow me to experience creating software for a client.
